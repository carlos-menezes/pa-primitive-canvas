# pa-primitive-canvas

The objective of this project is to create a 3D scene view defined by the user using primitives (i.e. cubes and pyramids) and custom models (found in the `assets` folder).

Users are able to add custom models and load them into the scene, so long as the objects' file extension is `.obj`. They are also able to add a directional and/or ambient light source and move/rotate the object via UI controls or keyboards keys.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/carlos-menezes/pa-primitive-canvas.git`
2. `cd pa-primitive-canvas/src`
3. Start a server in the `src` folder and access it via the browser.
